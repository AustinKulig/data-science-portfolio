## LinkedIn Data Scraper

Leveraging Python, I built and deployed a 
<a href="https://github.com/AustinKulig/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bots/LinkedIn%20Data%20Scraper/Scraper%20Bot.py">web-scrapping bot</a> 
that automatically logs into a LinkedIn profile and scrapes data from job postings. Job title, location, and description data load into a SQLite database for modeling. 
A <a href="https://github.com/AustinKulig/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bots/LinkedIn%20Data%20Scraper/NLP%20Model.py">NLP (Natural language Processing) model</a>
cleans, analyzes, and outputs the top five data science job titles with the top five associated
hard and soft skills required.

After analyzing over 1,000 job listings, the project results helped dampen the noise in the job search process and 
helped focus my attention on learning relevant skills to attain a data science position. So what hard skills does a <i>Data Scientist</i> need?
