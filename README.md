## LinkedIn Data Scraper 

<a href="https://github.com/AustinKulig/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Bots/LinkedIn%20Data%20Scraper"> Full Project Repository</a>

The decision to pursue a data science career track brought with it a host of questions, one of the first being - <i>what 
in-demand, hard skills should I learn to best position my job search? </i> As I scoured LinkedIn in search of answers, a thought
quickly pervaded my mind. <i>Why not leverage the job description data on LinkedIn to capture a snapshot of the in-demand 
data science skills</i>

Leveraging Python, I built and deployed a 
<a href="https://github.com/AustinKulig/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bots/LinkedIn%20Data%20Scraper/Scraper%20Bot.py">web-scrapping bot</a> 
that automatically logs into a LinkedIn profile and scrapes data from job postings. Job title, location, and description data load into a SQLite database for modeling. 
A <a href="https://github.com/AustinKulig/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bots/LinkedIn%20Data%20Scraper/NLP%20Model.py">NLP (Natural language Processing) model</a>
cleans, analyzes, and outputs the top five data science job titles with the top five associated
hard and soft skills required.

After analyzing over 1,000 job listings, the project results helped dampen the noise in the job search process and 
helped focus my attention on learning relevant skills to attain a data science position. So what hard skills does a <i>Data Scientist</i> need?
A working knowledge of:

<ul>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Tableau</li>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Spark</li>
</ul>
